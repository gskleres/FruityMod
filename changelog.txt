**V1**

* Chopping Woods, Jungles, and Marshes now provides only 50% of the default Food or Production.
* Deleting units is no longer possible.
* Plot tooltip delay reduced (appears much faster).
* Status tooltip no longer has a black box and is much smaller and compact, preventing message spam from blocking your view.
